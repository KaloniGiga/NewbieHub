# Welcome... 

# Why are you here?

There aren't many (if not any) platform for programmer (focused):
       - to find people with interest in similar technology and colloborate on a project.
       - gain experience as a beginner by working on a project without a need for a interview or joining company.
       
 So we're going to build one. 

# Who can work in this project.
 AnyOne with a basic command on the technologies used and willingness to learn more can collaborate on this project.

# DevHub

## Welcome... 

### What are we building ?
   There aren't many (if not any) platform for programmer (focused):
      --> to find people with interest in similar technology and colloborate on a project.
      --> gain experience as a beginner by working on a project without a need for a interview or joining company.
       
 So we're going to build one.
